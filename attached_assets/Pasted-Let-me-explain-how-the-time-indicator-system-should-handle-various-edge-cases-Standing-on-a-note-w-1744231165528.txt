Let me explain how the time indicator system should handle various edge cases:

Standing on a note with time:
    Show progress within the current time segment
    Grey dot position should be calculated relative to next timed note
    If no next timed note exists, the indicator should remain centered

No notes with time:
    Time indicator should remain hidden (opacity set to 0)
    Both dots should be invisible since there's no timing context

Last note with time:
    System should detect it's the final time marker
    Time indicator should remain visible but centered
    No offset calculation should occur since there's no "next" target

Note with no time, but time on previous notes:
    System should look backward to find the last time marker
    Calculate expected position based on that time marker and the next one found
    Show progress between those two points

Note with no time, but time on later notes:
    System should look forward to find the next time marker
    No progress should be shown until reaching a slide between two time markers
    Indicator should remain hidden until entering a timed segment

Start and End slides:
    Special case: these slides should be excluded from time calculations
    Time indicator should be hidden on these slides
    System should resume calculations when entering the main presentation content

The code handles this through the TimeIndicator component's effect hooks:

First effect finds the relevant time markers:

for (let i = currentIndex; i >= 0; i--) { // Look backward for previous time marker }

Second effect calculates progress only when valid markers exist:

if (hasTimeInfo && timeInfo) { calculateProgress(); }

Visibility is controlled by the hasTimeInfo state:

style={{
  opacity: hasTimeInfo ? 1 : 0
}}

This should create a robust system that gracefully handles edge cases by:

Only showing the indicator when meaningful timing data exists
Maintaining visual consistency during transitions
Preventing invalid calculations when time markers are missing
Providing smooth fallbacks for incomplete timing information
